// 384 kbps = rate 49152				2.0 Mbps = rate 262144					12 Mbps = Use the maximum!

rate			786432	// def. 196608  min. 20480  max. 786432	- Maximum Download Bandwidth in bytes per second.

cl_updaterate	128		// def. 64								- Maximum number of Update Packets per second, received from the Server. Gets adjusted by the Servers TickRate if Server TR < cl_updaterate. Also bound to cl_cmdrate via sv_client_cmdrate_difference 0.
